Implementation of the computation of geodesic in the Wasserstein space on Discrete surfaces as described in the paper "Dynamical Optimal Transport on Discrete Surfaces"

It reproduces the figures that can be found in the article. The parameters and the boundary conditions for each example are hard-coded in the files example_****.py

Dependencies: 
	Mayavi

Example: 
	python example_****.py where ****.py is the name of the specific figure you want to reproduce
